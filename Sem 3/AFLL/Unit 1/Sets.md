#### What is a Set?
* A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, which may include anything

#### Set Representation?
* A set can be represented in any one of the following three ways or forms
	* **Descriptive form or Statement form**
		* "The set of all even numbers"
	* **Set-Builder form or Rule form**
		* A = { n | n ∈ N and n is even }
	* **Roster form or Tabular form**
		* A = { -1, 0,1, 2, 3, 4 }
#### Cardinality of a Set 
* The cardinality of a set is the number of elements contained in a set 
* Denoted by |S|
* Example : A = {a,b,c,d,e} then |A| = 5

#### Types of Set
* ***Empty Set or NULL Set***
	* Set doesn't have any values
* ***Singleton Set*** 
	* Set contains only one element
* ***Finite Set***
	* Set contains only finite elements
* ***Infinite Set***
	* Set contains infinite elements
* ***Equivalent Set***
	* If the cardinality of two sets are the same then they are equal
* ***Equal Set*** 
	* Two sets are said to be equal when the have the same elements. Order does not matter
* ***Disjoint Set***
	* If two sets contain no common elements
* ***Subsets***
	* If all elements of one set are also the elements of another set 
	* Examples:
		{ 1, 2, 3 } ⊆ { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
* ***Proper Subset*** 
	* If all elements of a set except atleast one are also the elements of another set
	* Example :
		A = {1, 3, 5}	B = { 1, 5}   C = { 1, 3, 5}
		then,	B ⊂A	But, C ⊆A
* ***Super Set***
* ***Universal Set*** 
	* All elements under consideration
* ***Power Set***
	* Set of all subsets of the main set including the empty set and the main set itself
	* S = {a, b, c, d}
		P(S) = {Ø, {a}, {b}, {c}, {d},	{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d},	{a, b, c}, {a, b, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d}, {a, b, c, d}}
