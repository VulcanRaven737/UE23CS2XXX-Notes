#### Regular Language 
* A regular language is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression.
* A formal language is called regular if it is accepted by a finite state automaton.
* A Regular language can be specified either
	* By a regular expression that expresses a regular language as a pattern to which every string in the regular language conforms.
	* By a regular grammar that generates the strings of the regular language, or
	* By a finite-state automaton that accepts (or recognizes) the regular language.
#### Regular Expression
* A regular expression is a concise way to describe a set of strings in a language.
