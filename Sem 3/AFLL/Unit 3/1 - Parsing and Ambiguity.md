* CFG can either be linear or nonlinear 
* When CFG is nonlinear it gives rise to ambiguous grammar 
* **A grammar is ambiguous when there exists 2 or more LMDs or 2 or more RMDs (1 LMD and 1 RMD cannot prove that it is ambiguous). This gives rise to multiple parse trees as well**
* There is no hard and fast method to prove ambiguous nature of the language other than trial and error 
* Ambiguity must be eliminated 

**NOTE - LMD parse tree is same as the RMD parse tree. There is no difference between the two**

#### Ambiguous Grammar Elimination
* Can be eliminated by showing that there exists atleast one unambiguous grammar for the same
* By converting ambiguous grammar to unambiguous
