#### What is a Proposition
* **Propositions are declarative sentences which are either universally true or universally false but not both**
* They are the building blocks of logic

#### Syntax 
* Gives meaning to the sentences in the language and defines them
* **Atomic Sentences**
	* Consists of a *single proposition symbol* 
	* Each symbol stands for a proposition that can either be true or false 
	* There are only 2 proposition symbols in atomic sentences and they have a fixed meaning 
		* **TRUE** - Always true proposition
		* **FALSE** - Always false proposition
* **Complex Sentences**
	* Constructed from simple sentences
	* There are *five logical connectives*
		* **∨** (Dis-junction) [OR]
		* **∧** (Conjunction) [AND]
		* **¬** (Negation) [NOT]
		* **⇒** (Implies) [IMPLIES]
		* **⇐⇒** (Bidirectional) [IF AND ONLY IF]
	* Order of precedence 
		* **¬** > **∧** > **∨** > **⇒** > **⇐⇒**
		* NOT > AND > OR > IMPLIES > BIDIRECTIONAL

#### Semantics 
* The Semantics defines the rules for determining the truth of a sentence with respect to a particular model
