 When translating a high level language to assembly language, the compiler must be able to implement all the constructs like variables, pointers and arrays. The different ways in which the location of an operand is specified in an instruction is referred to as **addressing modes**

#### What is Addressing Mode?
* It specifies a rule or method for interpreting or modifying the address field of the instruction before the operand is actually accessed for manipulation
* It reduces the number of bits in the address field of an instruction
* Following are the 8 different types of address modes 
	* **Immediate Mode**
	* **Absolute (Direct) Mode**
	* **Register Mode**
	* **Indirect Mode**
	* **Indexed Mode**
	* **Relative Mode**
	* **Auto Increment Mode**
	* **Auto Decrement Mode**
**Note - Instruction has 2 fields : *Opcode and Address field***

#### Immediate Mode
* The operand is specified directly in the instruction itself
* The instruction has an operand field instead of an address field
* A pound **#** symbol has to precede the value of operand
	* Eg: **MOVE #5, R0**

#### Absolute (Direct) Mode
* Operands reside in memory and its address is given explicitly in the address field of the instruction
* It offers only limited memory address space 

#### Register Addressing Mode 
* The operand is the contents of a register appearing in the instruction
	* Eg: **ADD R1, R2**
* Results in speedy execution since register is inside the processor and has low access time 
* There are limited number of registers in the processor though

#### Indirect Mode 
* Eg: **ADD (A), R0**
	* where A = B = R1
* It uses one less memory reference 

#### Indexed Mode 
* Effective address of the operand is generated by adding a constant value to the contents of the register 
* The constant value may be either an offset value called displacement or beginning address of data in memory
	* Eg: **ADD 20(R1), R2**
		* Here X = 20 which is the beginning address and R1 = 1040, R1 is the offset 
	* OR Eg: **ADD 1040(R1), R2**
		* Here X = 1040 which is the beginning address and R1 = 20 which is the offset
* Index addressing is fast and excellent for manipulating data structures such as arrays, as all that is needed is the base address and using the index, we can access the individual elements

#### Relative Mode 
* This scheme supplies the relative position of the memory operand to be located 
* It is just like the index mode but only difference is that, the PC is used to get the base address
	* Eg: **ADD X(PC)** 
		* EA = [PC] + X

#### Auto Increment Mode 
*
