* **Used to measure the independence of two categorical variables**
	* If one variable has an effect on another
	* Eg: Does the gender of the person determine which chocolate they like
* **It is also used to measure goodness of fit** 
	* If the observed values match the expected values
* **Used when the data is categorical**
	* When data can be classified into groups (yes/no, green/blue/black, good/better/best)

#### Formula
![[Pasted image 20241110100106.png]]
**Oi = Observed Values**
**Ei = Expected Value**

* If the chi-squared statistic is < critical value
	* Fail to reject H0 or accept H0
* If the chi-squared statistic > critical value
	* Reject H0 or accept H1

**Note - Usually H0 is considered for unbiased conditions whereas H1 is considered for biased conditions**
**ie: Null hypothesis is that the probabilities of the outcomes are the same for each experiment**
