* We can never be sure what value distinguished the plausibility of the null hypothesis
* But if we had to make a decision and choose a critical point, this would be called fixed level testing 
* **If P ≤ α, reject H0 . If P > α, do not reject H0 
* The rejection region is dependent on the alternate hypothesis. α% of the normal distribution 
	* If H1 > mu
		* Rejection region is mu > α%
		* Upper region of α
	* If H1 < mu
		* Rejection region is mu < α%
		* It is taken as negative
		* Lower region of α
