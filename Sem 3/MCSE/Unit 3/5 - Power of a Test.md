* The power of a test is the probability of rejecting H0 when it is false 
* **Power = 1 - P [Type II error]**
	* **= 1-β**
	* 50% power means that there's a 50% chance of getting significant results when the effect is real

#### How large must the Power be for a Test?
* In general tests with power >80% or 0.8 are considered acceptable 
* The purpose of power calculation is to determine whether or not a hypothesis test, when performed is likely to reject H0, in the event that H0 is false

**Note - 
* **If μ is close to H0 : The power will be small
* **If μ is far from H0 : The power will be large**

* When power is not large enough, it can be increased by increasing the sample size 

#### Factors affecting Power of a Test
* Greater the sample size, greater the power 
* Greater the significance level, greater the power 
* Power is higher with a one tailed test than with a two tailed test. A one tailed test raises the significance level
