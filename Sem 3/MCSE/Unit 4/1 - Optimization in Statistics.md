#### Components of Optimization Problems 
* **Decision Variables**
	* These are the variables that can be controlled or adjusted in order to achieve the optimal value of the objective function
	* They are the unknown quantities which need to be determined
* **Objective Function**
	* This is the function which needs to be maximized or minimized
	* The goal of this function is to find the input values which maximize or minimize the output of this function
* **Constraints**
	* They are the conditions or the limitations imposed on the decision variables
* **Feasible Region**
	* Represents the set of all possible values for the decision variables that satisfy all the constraints including non-negativity
	* The optimal solution lies within this region

#### Feasible Solution vs Optimal Solution
* Feasible solution is any solution that satisfies all the constraints of the optimization problem but it may or may not provide the best outcome for the objective function
* An optimal solution is a feasible solution which is the one that maximizes the objective function depending on the goal of the optimization problem
