* Linear Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best possible outcome or solution from a given set of parameters or constraints which are linear
* The goal is to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints

#### Method of solving LPP
* Graphical Method
	* Limited to only LPP models containing 2 decision variables 
	* Make use of Extreme-Point evaluation method (Corner Point method)
* Simplex Method
	* Is used to find the optimum solution which have more than 2 decision variables
