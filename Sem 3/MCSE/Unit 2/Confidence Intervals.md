#### What is CI?
* Confidence Interval gives us the interval of values within which we can estimate the values with a certain level of confidence. 
* The width of CI tells us about how certain or uncertain we are about the true figure in the population
* A confidence interval is how much uncertainty there is with any particular statistic.
* It tells you how confident you can be that the results from a poll or survey reflect what you would expect to find if it were possible to survey the entire population.

#### Factors affecting CI
* **Population Size** - Affects the CI when working with smaller population/groups
* **Sample Size** - Smaller the sample, less likely it is to be confident with results 
* **Percentage** - Extreme answers come with better accuracy. Eg: *99% of voters are for a particular party, the chances of error are small*

**Note - A 0% confidence level means you have no faith that if you repeated the survey, you would get the same results. On the other hand if you have 100% confidence level it means that you have no doubt that if you repeated the survey you would get the same results**

#### Confidence Intervals v/s Confidence Levels

| CI                                                                          | CL                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| It tells us the interval or range in which we expect to find the results in | They are represented as a percentage |

#### Confidence Coefficient 
* It is the confidence level stated as a proportion rather than as a percentage
* If confidence level = 99% then confidence coefficient = 0.99
* Higher the coefficient, more certain you are that your results are accurate

#### Significance Level
* Alpha(α) is called the significance level
* Confidence Coefficient is taken as (1-α)
* Confidence level is taken as (1-α)*100%

#### Margin of Error
* it provides a bound to the difference between a particular estimate and the parameter that it estimates
* **MOE (For 95% CI) = 1.96 * standard error of estimator**
* MOE is half the width of the CI
* For Point Estimator of population Mean **X** = 1.96 * s/root n
* For Point Estimator of Proportion **P** = 1.96 * root(pq/n)

#### Confidence Interval 
* CI for a population mean = **X(+-)* Z * s/root(n)**
* CI for a population proportion = **P(+-)* Z * root(pq/n)**

#### Width of a Confidence Interval
* Width of a CI is the difference in the two limits
* Width = Upper Limit - Lower Limit
	* If **X** increases, width is unaffected 
	* Is S decreases, width decreases 
	* If CL decreases, width decreases 
	* If n increases, width decreases

#### Probability v/s Confidence 
* Probability refers to random events, which can come out of differently when experiments are repeated 
* With confidence interval there is no randomness involved. We are with a certain percentage sure, that the mean will lie in the predefined interval

#### One-Sided Confidence Intervals
* Lower Confidence Bound 
	* X - Z*(S/root(n))
* Upper Confidence Bound 
	* X + Z*(S/root(n))
