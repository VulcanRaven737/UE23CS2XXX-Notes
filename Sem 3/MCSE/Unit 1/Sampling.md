#### Terminologies related to Sampling
* **Target/Theoretical Population** - The population to which the results are to be generalized 
* **Sampling Frame** - The list from which potential samples are drawn. It is usually a tangible representation of the Target Population
* **Sampling Unit** - Smallest unit from which a sample can be selected
* **Sampling Scheme** - Method of selecting sampling units from a sampling frame
* **Sample** - All selected respondents from a sampling frame
Note - The selected sample must be representative of the population. If the sample isn't randomly selected then it will be biased and will not be representative of the entire population.

#### Sampling Process
**Defining Target Population** ---> **Specifying Sample frame** ---> **Specify Sampling Method** ---> **Determining Sample size** ---> **Implementing the Sampling Plan** ---> **Sampling and data collection** ---> **Reviewing the Sampling process**.

#### Types of Sampling Methods
* **Non Probability Samples**
	* Sampling in which every unit in the population does not have a chance greater than zero, of being selected in the sample
	* Some units have no chance of being selected. Referred to as 'Out of Coverage'
	* Selection of elements is not random and hence more likely to produce errors as it is biased
	* Not appropriate for most of the statistical analysis
		* ***Convenience*** 
			* Also known as *Grab or Opportunity Sampling* or *Accidental or Haphazard Sampling* 
			* Sample is drawn from the part of population which is close to hand and is readily available
			* Cannot make scientific generalizations about the population using this kind of sample as it is not representative enough
		* ***Judgement***
			* Choosing a sample based on who is appropriate for the study
			* It is biased and is not a scientific method of sampling
		* ***Quota***
			* Sample elements are selected until the quota controls are satisfied
			* Population is divided into mutually exclusive groups like strata and judgement is then used to select sample units from each segment. The sample units are selected based on predetermined characteristics of the population
			* Similar to stratified sampling but does not involve random selection
		* ***Snowball***
			* In this type of sampling, survey subjects are selected based on referral from other survey respondents
			* Existing subjects nominate further subjects known to them so that the sample increases in size like a rolling snowball
			* Used when subjects are difficult to trace and desired sample characteristic is rare
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Probability Samples**
	* Sampling in which every unit in the population has a chance greater than zero, of being selected in the sample and this probability can be accurately determined 
	* When every element in the population has the same probability of selection, it is known as 'Equal Probability of Selection' (EPS) design. All sampled units are given the same weight
		* ***Simple Random***
			* Entirely random method of selecting the sample
			* Every unit in the population has an equal chance of being selected
			* Follows EPS design
			* Further subdivided into Simple Random with Replacement and Simple Random without Replacement
		* ***Systematic***
			* Works by arranging the target population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals though that ordered list
			* The first element is randomly selected between the first to the Kth element
			* It proceeds with the selection of every Kth element from then on. K = (Population Size / Sample Size)
			* It also follows the EPS design as all elements have an equal chance of being selected
		* ***Stratified*** 
			* Works by dividing the population into 2 or more groups called strata based on a trait or characteristic
			* Then Simple Random samples are selected from each strata/group
			* Every unit in a stratum has an equal chance of being selected.
			* If the size of the samples selected is proportional to the size of the respective strata, then it follows the EPS design.
			* Finally all the samples from different strata's are combined
		* ***Cluster***
			* The population is divided into clusters usually based on geographical locations or other natural form of grouping.
			* Each cluster is a microcosm of the population
			* Instead of sampling the elements of a cluster, the entire cluster as a whole is selected as a sample, randomly. Hence if the population has 8 clusters, 2 whole clusters are selected for sampling.
			* Each cluster has heterogeneous members
			* There are further 2 types of cluster sampling methods
				* One stage sampling - All of the elements within a selected cluster are included in the sample
				* Two stage sampling - A subset of elements within a selected cluster are randomly selected for inclusion in the sample.

| Clustered Sampling                                                 | Stratified Sampling                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Best when elements within the cluster are internally heterogeneous | Best when elements within the cluster are internally homogeneous |
#### Sample Size
* For probability sampling, the larger the sample size, the better
* The more heterogeneous a population is, the larger the sample size needs to be
* Main factors affecting sample size are 
	* Size of the population
	* Margin of error
	* Confidence level
#### Sample Statistic & Population Parameter
* Sample Statistic 
	* Piece of information inferred from a fraction of a population ie: A sample
	* Statistic computed from the sample data
	* Mean, Median and Standard Deviation, Percentiles and Quantiles
* Population Parameter
	* Quantity or Statistical measure for a given population is called Population Parameter
	* Statistic computed from the entire population
	* Mean and Variance
#### Errors in Sampling
* Sampling Error or Random Error
	* Occurs when sample is not representative of the population
	* There is discrepancy between the sample statistic and the population parameter
	* Theoretical methods can be used to measure the extent of the of the variation caused by the sampling error
* Non Sampling Error or Systematic Error
	* Occurs during data collection, causing the data to differ from the true values
	* Mistakes are made during the data collection process and data processing
	* Major sources are - Sampling Bias, Non-response Bias, Selection Bias
		* Sampling Bias occurs when a chosen sample is not representative enough of the larger population
		* Non-Response Bias occurs when certain members of the sample are absent
		* Selection Bias is a type of bias in which some members of the population have a higher or lower chance of being sampled than others
* Sampling Variation
	* Simple random samples almost always differ from their populations in some ways. Two different samples from the same population will differ from each other as well
	* Sampling Variation is the reason why experiments produce different results when repeated even when conditions are kept consistent
