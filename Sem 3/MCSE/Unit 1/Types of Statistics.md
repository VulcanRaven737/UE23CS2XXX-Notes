#### Branches of Statistics
* The study of statistics has two major branches
	* **Descriptive Statistics** 
		* Involves organization, summarization and display of data 
		* Provides methods for organizing and summarizing data
		* **Descriptive value for a population is called a parameter and for a sample is called a statistic** 
		* ***Purpose - To describe data, Collect data, Present data, Characterize data***
			* **Organize Data**
				* **Tables** 
					* *Frequency Distributions*
					* *Relative Frequency Distributions*
				* **Graphs**
					* *Bar Chart or Histogram*
					* *Stem and Leaf Plot*
					* *Frequency Polygon*
			* **Summarize Data** 
				* **Central Tendency**
					* *Mean*
					* *Median* 
					* *Mode* 
				* **Variation**
					* *Range*
					* *Interquartile Range*
					* *Variance* 
					* *Standard Deviation*
	* **Inferential Statistics**
		* Involves using a sample to draw conclusions about a population. 
		* **It utilizes sample data to make estimates, decisions, prediction or other generalizations about a larger set of data**
		* There are 2 main areas of inferential statistics 
			* **Estimating Parameters**
				* This means taking a statistic from the sample data (sample mean) and using it to say something about a population parameter (population mean)
			* **Hypothesis Tests**
				* Sample data is used to answer research questions
		* ***Purpose - To make decision about population characteristics*** 
#### The Difference

| **Descriptive Statistics**                                        | **Inferential Statistics**                                                              |

| *Describes the target population*                               | *Makes inferences from the sample and generalizes them to the population*             |
| *Organize, Analyze and Present the data in a meaningful manner* | *Compares, Tests and Predicts the outcomes of an entire population based on a sample* |
| *Represented using charts and graphs and tables*                | *Represented using Probability Scores*                                                |
| *Describes already known data*                                  | *Makes conclusions about the population using data available*                         |
| *Central Tendency and Variation are used as tools*              | *Hypothesis Testing and Analysis of Variance is used as tools*                        |
#### Measures of Central Tendency - Descriptive Statistics
* **Mean** 
	* It is arithmetic average computed by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the number of data values 
	* The population mean is represented by Greek letter **µ**.
	* The sample mean is represented by **x̄**
* **Weighted Mean**
	* It is an average where certain values of the data set contribute more to the mean value than the rest
* **Trimmed Mean**
	* Computed by arranging the sample values in order and then 'Trimming' and equal number of them from each end and computing the mean of the remaining values
	* Most commonly used trimmed means are 5%, 10% and 20% trimmed means
	* It us used to reduce the effects of outliers on the calculated average
* **Median**
	* It is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or probability distribution
	* It is the middlemost number in a sorted ascending or descending list of numbers and is usually more descriptive of the data set than the average 
	* **If n is odd, median = (n+1/2)th element’s value**
	* **If n is even, median = ((n/2)th element’s value + (n/2  + 1)th element’s value))/2**
* **Mode**
	* It is the value that appears the most often in a set of data values 
	* If a dataset has more than 1 mode it is described as multi-modal
###### ***3*Median - 2*Mean = Mode***
#### Skewed and Symmetric Distributions 
* Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of values about its mean. The mean and median of this distribution lie further towards the skew than the mode. The greater the distance between the mean and median, the greater is the skewness of the distribution
* Symmetric Distribution is one where the left and right hand sides of the distribution are roughly equally balanced around the mean. Mean, Median and Mode have the same values in symmetric distribution
* If **Mean = Median = Mode** the shape of the distribution is **symmetric** 
* if **Mode < Median < Mean** the shape of the distribution is **positively skewed** 
* if **Mean < Median < Mode** the shape of the distribution is **negatively skewed**

#### Measures of Spread 
* **Variance**
	* It is a measure of the spread of the recorded values on a variable
	* It measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value
	* The larger the variance, further the individual cases from the mean while the smaller the variance, the closer the individual scores are to the mean
	* ![[Pasted image 20240907175247.png]]
* **Standard Deviation**
	* Signifies the deviation of the elements of the data set from the mean value of the distribution
	* It quantifies the amount of the variation of a set of data values
	* Estimation of Standard Deviation becomes more stable as the sample size increases
	* SD is zero only when all the values of a distribution are the same
