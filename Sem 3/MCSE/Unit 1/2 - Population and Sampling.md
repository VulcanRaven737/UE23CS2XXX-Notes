#### What is Statistical Analysis?
* It is the science of collecting, exploring and presenting large amounts of data to discover underlying patterns and trends.
* The basic idea is to make inferences about a population by studying a small sample chosen from it.

#### Population and Sample
**A** - Population
* A population is the entire collection of objects or outcomes about which information is sought.
* The population is analyzed through the means of a sample.

**B** - Sample
* A sample is a subset of a population which contains the objects or outcomes that are observed.
* The size of a sample is always less than that of the population.
* The number of items in a sample are called *sample items
* Process of taking a number of observations from a population is called *sampling

| **Population**                                        | **Sample**                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| The complete set                                      | Subset of the population                             |
| Hard to observe                                       | Easier to observe and draw inferences                |
| Time consuming to study                               | Less time consuming to study                         |
| Contains all members of a group                       | Only represents a subset of all members of the group |
| No margin of error when analyzing opinions of a group | Margin of error exists                               |
#### Types of Population
* **Tangible/Concrete Population**
	* Populations where the members are physical objects are called tangible 
	* They are assumed to be finite and can be counted 
* **Conceptual Population**
	* Populations that do not consist of physical or actual objects are called conceptual
	* Mostly the results of measuring a tangible item
* **Target Population**
	* Group of individuals or objects to which researchers are interested in generalizing conclusions
* **Study Population**
	* The population to which the researchers can apply their conclusions to
	* Subset of the target population and can be limited to a region, city or state
