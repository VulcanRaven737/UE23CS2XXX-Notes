#### Qualitative Data
* Measurements that cannot be recorded on a numerical scale but can be recorded in categories
* Information can be sorted by category and not by number
	* ***Nominal*** 
		* Category which does not follow any particular order or direction
		* Least powerful in measurement with no arithmetic order and hence is very restrictive with limited use
		* Cannot be mathematically manipulated but can be visualized using graphs and charts
	* **Ordinal**
		* Category for which the values are ordered
		* Mathematical operations can still not be carried out on this sort of data because they only show sequence and have no absolute value
		* Example - Ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd), Rating (5*, 4*, 3*)

| Aspect               | Nominal Data            | Ordinal Data                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Order                | No inherent order       | Has a meaningful order           |
| Interval Meaning     | No meaningful intervals | Intervals are not equal or known |
| Examples             | Gender, Colors, Type    | Ratings, Income Brackets         |
| Statistical Analysis | Mode, Frequency         | Median, Mode                     |

#### Quantitative Data
* Measurements that are recorded on a naturally occurring numerical scale
* Can be easily statistically manipulated and can be represented by wide variety of graphs and charts
* Example - GPA, Age, Salary, Cost 
	* ***Discrete***
		* Set of data is said to be discrete if the values belonging to the set are separate
		* The data values cannot be divided into smaller parts and can be counted as a whole
		* Example - Number of students in a class, Number of bones in a human body
		* Bar charts are used to display discrete data effectively
	* **Continuous***
		* Set of data is said to be continuous if the values belonging to the set can take on any value within a finite or infinite interval
		* Histograms are used to display continuous data effectively
	* ***Interval***
		* Data type which is measured along a scale in which each point is placed at an equidistant position
		* They don't have a meaningful zero
		* Can have negative data values 
		* Example - Temperature
	* ***Ratio***
		* Also measured along a scale but has a true zero
		* Does not have any negative values due it true zero nature
		* Example - Speed, Age, Weight
		* Most precise data and all statistical techniques can be applied on them
#### Attribute or Variable
* Attribute/Variable is a data field, representing a character or feature of a data object
* It is the property of a data object which is measured for each observation or record
* Example - Name, Age, ID, Address, Marks (Basically equal to Data type)
* Properties
	* Distinctness : =, !=
	* Order : >, <
	* Addition : +, -
	* Multiplication : *, /
* ***Nominal Attribute - Distinctness***
* ***Ordinal Attribute - Distinctness and Order***
* ***Interval Attribute - Distinctness, Order and Addition***
* ***Ratio Attribute - All 4 properties***
