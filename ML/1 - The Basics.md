#### What are ML Models?
* Traditional models required people to edit the parameters to work effectively 
* ML models are special, they are shaped by data and they learn by experience 
* A model is a function that works by taking an input and producing an output
* The model uses parameter(s) which act on the input to produce the output. These parameters are adjusted during an automated learning process called training 

### What are the Inputs and Outputs?
* Models are trained using data and 2 pieces of code called the **objective function** and the **optimizer function**
* **The Objective**
	* This function represents what the model should be able to do 
	* This is also called as the **cost function** and it judges whether the model i s doing a good job or bad job of predicting
* **The Data**
	* This is the information provided to the model 
	* It is the information which is required by the cost function
* **The Optimizer**
	* During training, the model makes a prediction and the objective function calculates how well it performed. 
	* The optimizer is code that changes the model's parameters so that the model does a better job next time 
* Objective, Data and Optimizer are simply means of training data and are not required once training is completed
