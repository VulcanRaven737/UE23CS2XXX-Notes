* In the Transformation stage, the problem's instance is modified to be more amenable to the solution
* In the second stage or conquering stage, it is solved
* There are 3 types of transformations which can take place 
	* Transformation to a simpler or more convenient instance of the same problem - called **instance simplification**
	* Transformation to a different representation of the same instance - called **representation change**
	* **Transform to the instance of different problem**

#### Heap and Heap Sort 
* Heap is partially ordered data structure that is suitable for implementing priority queues
* Priority queue is a multi-set of items with an orderable characteristic called an item's priority with the following operations 
	* Finding items with the highest priority 
	* Deleting items with the highest priority
	* Adding a new item to the multiset
* A heap is a complete binary tree and it has the heap property of children nodes having a key value less than the parent key value
* Height of Heap is **log(n) base 2**
* There exists bottom-up approach and top-down approach to creating a heap
