* Brute force is a straightforward approach to solving a problem usually based on definitions 
* It systematically enumerates all possible candidates for the solution and checks if the candidate satisfies the problem's statement 

#### Sorting Algorithms 
* **Selection Sort**
	* Scan the array to find its smallest element and swap it with the first element, putting the smallest element in its final position in the sorted list 
	* Next scan the elements right of the first element and search for the smallest element and swap it 
* **Bubble Sort**
	* Compare adjacent elements of the list and exchange them if they are out of order
	* By doing it repeatedly we end up bubbling the largest element to the last position on the list
