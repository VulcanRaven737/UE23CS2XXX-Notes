* An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem
* You can obtain the required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time
#### Requirements to be considered for an Algorithm
* The algorithm has to be non ambiguous 
* The range of inputs for the algorithm has to be specified carefully
Note - Check recursive algorithms for calculating GCD of two numbers

#### Characteristics of an Algorithm 
* **Input** 
	* Values are supplied externally 
* **Definiteness**
	* Each instruction is clear and unambiguous
* **Finiteness**
	* Algorithm terminates in finite number of steps
* **Effectiveness**
	* Each instruction must be feasible 
* **Output**
	* At least one value is produced
