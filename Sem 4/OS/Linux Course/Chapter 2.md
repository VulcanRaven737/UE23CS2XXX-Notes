#### Linux History 
* Linux was initially developed for Intel x86 based computers. 
* It has been now ported to a long list of other hardware platforms 
* Linux was re-licensed under the GPL (General Public License) by GNU. By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous developers created complete systems called Linux Distributions 
* Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux Kernel
* Linux started as fully free (in the sense of freedom not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software development. 
	* Mid 90's - Created for fully free computing and for open source software development 
	* 1998 - Major companies like IBM and Oracle announced support 
	* Today - Linux is used to power over 96% of the world's web servers and Android smartphones. It powers all of the world's most powerful supercomputers 
#### Linux Philosophy 
* Linux is constantly enhanced and maintained by a network of developers from all over the world collaborating over the internet with Linus Torvalds at the head 
* Technical skills, desire to contribute and ability to collaborate with others are the only qualification for participating 
* Linux borrows heavily from the well established family of Unix operating systems. It was written to be free and open source 
* Unix was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs 
* Files are stored in a hierarchical file-system with the top node of the system being the root or simply '/'
* Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. 
* **Linux is fully multitasking, multi-user OS with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons** 

#### Linux Terminology
* **Kernel** - It is considered the brain of the OS as it controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact with the applications 
* **Distribution** - Also known as distros, is a collection of programs combined with the Linux Kernel to make up a Linux-based OS
* **Boot Loader** - The boot loader is a program that boots the OS. GRUB and ISOLINUX are examples
* **Service** - A service is a program that runs as a background process. **httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd and named** are some services 
* **Filesystem** - It is a method of storing and organizing files in Linux. **ext4, FAT, XFS and Btrfs** are examples
* **Desktop Environment** - DE is a graphical UI on top of the OS. **GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox** are some some examples
* **Shell** - It is the command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the OS to perform task mentioned through the command line. **bash, tcsh and zsh** are examples

#### Linux Distributions 
* Kernel is the core of the OS. A full Linux distro consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-relation operations, user management, and software package management. 
* Linux kernel consists of the following services 
	* **Documentation for** 
		* **Commands** 
		* **Applications** 
		* **Service** 
	* **Libraries**
	* **Utilities** 
	* **Configuration** 
	* **Applications**
	* **Package Updates, Upgrades, Kernel and Driver patches** 

#### Summary
* **Linux borrows heavily from UNIX OS.**
* **Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects** 
* **Linux is a fully multi-tasking, multi-user OS with built in service processes known as daemons** 
* **A full Linux distro consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools**
