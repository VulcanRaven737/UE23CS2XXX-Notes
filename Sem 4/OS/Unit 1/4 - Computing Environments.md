* **Traditional** 
	* Stand alone general purpose machines
* **Mobile** 
	* Handheld smartphones, tablets
	* Main difference from traditional environments is the additional features the OS provides 
* **Distributed**
	* Collection of separate, possibly heterogeneous systems networked together 
	* Network OS provides features between systems across network
* **Client-Server**
	* Dumb terminals are replaced by smart PCs
	* Systems which act as servers now respond to requests generated by clients 
* **Peer-to-Peer**
	* P2P does not distinguish between client and server 
	* All nodes are considered as peers and each one may either act as client or server or both 
	* P2P must join the network and register its service with central lookup service on network or broadcast request for service and respond to requests for service **via discovery protocol**
* **Virtualization**
	* Allows operating systems to run application within other OSes 
	* Used for exploration or compatibility 
	* VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) is used to manage multiple virtual OSes. It can run natively
* **Cloud Computing**
	* Environments composed of traditional OSes, VMMs and other cloud management tools
	* Load balancers are used to spread traffic across multiple applications
* **Real Time Embedded Systems**
	* It is the most prevalent form of computers
